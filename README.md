# Modal_Logic_Tableaux_Solver
A tool to decide satisfiability of modal formulas, and if satisfiable, visualize them.

This is a work in progress, with the first goal being to achieve this for classical modal logic using the axioms from Minimum Modal Logic K, then adding in different axioms to correspond to frames with different relations (transitivity, reflexivity, etc.) to add functionality for different types of modal logic (using Kripke Semantics for all).

I'm creating this as part of my final paper for my Modal Logic class at UC Berkeley. There was no specific prompt or topic we needed to write about, merely the specification that whatever we do must relate to modal logic in significant ways and be conceptually interesting; thus, I decided to write this as a tool to help me quickly visualize models for many formulas in order to analyze and model the world view of various political figures, with Ben Shapiro and his arguments being a primary focus of the paper.

If you're a developer reading this and you'd like to use this tool for anything, feel free. If you want to copy all of my code and add it to something you're working on, go for it, just credit me somewhere and drop me a star. Thanks!
